__**Project Ideas:**__

- Maya Large Scene Procedure Tool

Creating a tool within Maya for reformatting large scenes that have become difficult to manage without computational solutions, including renaming, grouping and mass-applying tools and procedures. Works with both the pre-existing editor, extends it to allow for quick access to certain functions, and can allow for the use of shelf tools. Focusing more on a scene with several objects that may need to be altered similarly.

__**Possible functions**__

- Mass renaming (edit specifically long names to be unique, required due to previous export problems) /

- Mass parenting (used for organisational purposes) .5 (groups)

- Mass layer movement (^^^)

- Geometric function (i.e extrusion) on one object cascading to others

- Possible mass attribute editing and cascading attribute changes

- Possible organisational functions for complex scenes beyond this (i.e management ui


__**Cascading Protocols**__

- Full history stream save
- C++ conversion for history save without an external file
