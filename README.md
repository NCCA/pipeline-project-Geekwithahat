__**Project Ideas:**__

- Maya Large Scene Procedure Tool

Creating a tool within Maya for reformatting large scenes including renaming, grouping and mass applying tools and procedures. Works with both the pre-existing editor, extends it to allow for quick access to certain functions, and can allow for the use of shelf tools.

- Sample Scene code generator

Installs libraries and languages necesary for creating various basic scenes in a variety of different tools, without the need for user involvement.
